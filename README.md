# Pretrained models of DIC-Net
To further improve the performance of CNN for DIC tasks, we optimized the parameters within the framework of the method proposed in the paper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2022.107278.

The tuning of network structure and Hermite dataset parameters will be given in detail. And the predictable range, accuracy, spatial resolution, and noise level of the network will be given immediately afterwards. For the model version used in the paper, please refer to https://github.com/YinWang20/DIC-Net.
